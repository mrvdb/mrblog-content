<p>
After installing Snow Leopard I was left with a page of programs and
plugins that needed attention because of the upgrade. Most of these
were little nuisances and just needed a little reconfiguration. There
were a couple of things where Apple decided to rename an app or hide
it otherwise from view (Kerberos Ticket manager for example).
</p>

<p>
There were two things on the list which stopped me in my daily
work. The first was was the need to recompile the complete macports
collection. I won't go into the details of everything, but executing a
complete reinstall of macports apps takes about a day, not counting
the time needed to fix compile errors (wtf, all <code>*.la</code> files missing
now?).
</p>

<p>
The second was the disfunctioning of a number of Mail.app plugins. I
guess it's not really the plugin authors who have dropped the ball
here, as Apple had an early release of SL and many developers were
just not ready. However, that didn't change the fact my <code>*nix</code> tools and
mail were both severely crippled now.
</p>

<p>
Not looking forward to spending two days to recompile and reconfigure
everything and nothing new to show for I decided that a long time wish
could be sneaked in. Leaving Mail.app behind and switching to
<a href="http://claws-mail.org">Claws</a> as a mail client.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, these are the main gripes I have with Mail.app:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keyboard navigation is absent for all practical purposes;
</li>
<li>tabbing order in compose window or absence of shortcut keys to go to subject/body at once;
</li>
<li>weird threading decision; (altho i have to admit it works for the daily chores mail)
</li>
<li>no way to configure top/bottom posting;
</li>
<li>no nntp support;
</li>
<li>IMAP support does not include subscriptions;
</li>
<li>somehow it keeps locking up on me with tenacious regularity, i suspect sqlite here;
</li>
<li>the direction with yellowy sticky notes, the stationary things are all useless to me;
</li>
<li>proprietary, closed program (which I could live with&#x2026;)
</li>
<li>but worse, it has a non-documented API for plugins, which is an insult to developers.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I've always liked claws on linux. Tremendously fast, great keyboard
support, a feature-set which is more than I can handle in most areas
and a small enough codebase which makes it realistic for me to patch
it or write a plugin for, should I feel inclined to do so. The only
problem I really had was running OSX, so the lightweightedness would
be kinda lost, as I would need a while slew of dependencies. Still,
most of them I already had because of our internal implementation of
<a href="http://openerp.com">OpenERP</a>
</p>

<p>
I knew I would be running into issues, so the first couple of days I
ran with claws-mail inside <a href="http://virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> running an Ubuntu install. This
would give me sort of a reference to get everything working without
having to worry about compilation digging etc. Installing a new mail
application is easy but deciding if it is good enough to replace a
program which you use every minute of the day is something else.
</p>

<p>
I sort of knew after half a day I was going to like it. The slowness
of the virtual machine was a little bit in the way, as was its
instability, but overall things were looking good. Ok, time to repeat
the excercise for real on OSX.
</p>

<p>
Here's the configure step I used:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
    export CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include
    export LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib

    ./configure \
      --disable-trayicon-plugin \
      --disable-manual \
      --enable-ipv6 \
      --disable-dillo-viewer-plugin \
      --enable-crash-dialog
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The first two are perhaps redundant, but I wanted to make sure
everything came from the ports collection and not from libraries
supplied by Apple by default. Compiling afterwards gives you a
running, but ugly claws-mail. So, first thing I did was install a
bunch of gtk2 stuff to give me a bit of theme-ing options. I used
Platypus to create a Claws.app; the OSX application bundle so I can
have an icon in the Dock:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://mrblog.nl/files/2009/09/screen_006.png" alt="screen_006.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Apart from the icon, that does not give you much really. The app runs
as a child below X11.app so it still misbehaves in many ways, but
alas.
</p>

<p>
Next up was 'mailto' URI handling. I had thought this to be an easy
thing. OSX refuses to accept a shell script as handler though, it must
be an app bundle. So, what I needed was an app-bundle, as invisible as
possible which can act as an URI handler for claws. The first thing I
thought about was adapting <a href="http://mailtomutt.sourceforge.net">MailToMutt</a> to call out to claws instead of
mutt. Looking at the source I saw it was pretty much suitable to mutt
only, so I set out to write my own, How hard could this be?
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, such an app in its simplest form would require the
following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An info.plist file, as all app bundles have, with some special entries;
</li>
<li>A declaration of a handler on how to react to the involved 'Apple Events'
</li>
<li>The code of that handler.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The plist has to look something like this:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://mrblog.nl/files/2009/09/screen_007.png" alt="screen_007.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
There are 2 things in there which make this interesting. First, the
highlighted line marks this application as an 'Agent' which just means
to not show it anywhere on screen.
</p>

<p>
Second, a list of URL-types on which this URIhandler app should
react. As you can see I threw a bunch in there which I thought would
come in handy someday. What this does is make the app known to OSX as
being capable of handling these types of URLs. This is used, for
example by the Mail.app application for listing clients in its
preference for default Email program:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://mrblog.nl/files/2009/09/screen_009.png" alt="screen_009.png" />
</p>
</div>


<p>
The second file needed in the XCode project is URLHandler.scriptSuite:
</p>

{% highlight  properties %}
    {
        Name = URLHandler;
        AppleEventCode = "UrHD";

        Commands = {
            "GetURL" = {
                CommandClass = URLHandlerCommand;
                AppleEventCode = GURL;
                AppleEventClassCode = GURL;
            };
        };
    }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
which registers <code>URLHandlerCommand</code> as the handler for
Events of type GURL (get an URL).
</p>

<p>
And finally, the third file, <code>URLHanderlerCommand.m</code> which
implements that handler:
</p>

{% highlight objective-c %}
    @implementation URLHandlerCommand

    - (id)performDefaultImplementation {

        NSString *urlString = [self directParameter];
        NSURL    *url = [NSURL URLWithString: urlString];

        // Log what we got
        NSLog(@"url = %@", urlString);

        // Launch _handler script in path
        NSTask *task = [NSTask new];
        NSString *script = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"~/bin/%@_handler",[url scheme]];
        NSLog(@"launchtarget = %@", script);
        [task setLaunchPath:script];

        // Give the URI-string as parameter to that script
        [task setArguments:[NSArray arrayWithObject:urlString]];

        // Catch stdout / stderr
        [task setStandardOutput:[NSPipe pipe]];
        [task setStandardError:[task standardOutput]];

        // Run it
        [task launch];

        // Log the output, if any
        NSData* output = [[[task standardOutput] fileHandleForReading] readDataToEndOfFile];
        NSString* out_string = [[[NSString alloc] initWithData:output encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] autorelease];
        NSLog(@"%@",out_string);

            // If we are not there we cant do no harm, so quit.
        [[NSApplication sharedApplication] terminate:nil];

        return nil;
    }
    @end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
In words: It takes the URL that the user clicked on
"<a href="mailto:something@something.org">mailto:something@something.org</a>", turns it into an URL object and
calls out to the file &lt;code&gt;mailto<sub>handler</sub>&lt;/code&gt; in the Users bin
directory.
</p>

<p>
For a 'feed' URL the app would call the file <code>feed_handler</code>
and likewise for the other protocols. The <code>mailto_handler</code> file is
just a shell script containing:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
    /usr/local/bin/claws-mail --compose $1
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
and my <code>~/bin/feed_handler</code> contains:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
    /usr/local/bin/claws-mail --subscribe $1
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
If you would like a copy of the source of this program, go here:

</p>

<p>
The rest of the configuration went pretty smooth. I had a little
hickup getting GPG signing to work with both PGP and S/MIME
signatures. But a quick recompile of gpgme to include s/mime and a
[specific configuration](<a href="http://www.beitz.org/node/85">http://www.beitz.org/node/85</a>) which was not
obvious to me for gpg-agent solved that.
</p>

<p>
Here's a picture of the end result (click on it for large version):

<p>
So, is this install perfect? Is it even better than Mail.app? I'd say,
not yet. But the big difference is that I have control now and there's
only a gap of time and energy between me solving any gripe I might
have.
</p>

<p>
Which of the gripes have I solved with this? Let's recap:
</p>

<p>
<span style="color:green;font-weight: bold">✓</span>
keyboard navigation is absent for all practical purposes;<br />

keyboard navigation is strong, but not complete, in claws. One thing
which is missing is a keyboard way to collaps or expand a folder tree
(and thread, for that matter)
</p>

<p>
<span style="color:red;font-weight: bold">✘</span>
tabbing order in compose window or absence of shortcut keys to go to subject/body at once<br />
This one is unsolved, at least on osx. There is no key combination which allows to go to subject and / or body directly.
</p>

<p>
<span style="color:green;font-weight: bold">✓</span>
weird threading decision; (altho i have to admit it works for the daily chores mail)
</p>

<p>
<span style="color:green;font-weight: bold">✓</span>
no way to configure top/bottom posting;<br />
claws has templates, which allow you to configure what a reply (or forward) looks like. This includes the cursor position, so it allows for top-posting, bottom-posting or anywhere posting. And all this is per account.
</p>

<p>
<span style="color:green;font-weight: bold">✓</span>
no nntp support;<br />
claws has full nntp support.
</p>

<p>
<span style="color:green;font-weight: bold">✓</span>
IMAP support does not include subscriptions;
</p>

<p>
<span style="color:orange;font-weight: bold">?</span>
somehow it keeps locking up on me with tenacious regularity, i suspect sqlite here;<br />
We'll have to see how claws performs here.
</p>

<p>
<span style="color:green;font-weight: bold">✓</span>
the direction with yellowy sticky notes, the stationary things are all useless to me;
</p>

<p>
<span style="color:green;font-weight: bold">✓</span>
proprietary, closed program (which I could live with...)<br />
claws is licensed under the GPL v3
</p>

<p>
<span style="color:green;font-weight: bold">✓</span>
but worse, it has a non-documented API for plugins, which is an insult to developers.<br />
i'm not sure the claws API for plugins is documented (i havent looked) but being open source, there's enough to work with.
</p>

I'd say that is a pretty good score! If it feels like that in the real
world? Talk to me in 3 months :D I'm also pretty sure there will be a
whole set of new gripes waiting for me around the corner.
